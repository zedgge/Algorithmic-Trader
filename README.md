# 🧠 Algorithmic Trading & Machine Learning System

**Creator:** [Your Name]  
**Languages & Tools:** Python, PyTorch, CUDA, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Joblib, Alpaca API, Yahoo Finance, Vector Databases, Bloomberg API (integration in progress)  
**Focus:** Quantitative trading automation, predictive modeling, market research, and intelligent portfolio management.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository documents my **end-to-end algorithmic trading system**, originally built as a standalone desktop application — not a web interface.  
It combines **quantitative research, predictive modeling, and automated execution** into a unified framework capable of handling **multiple markets simultaneously**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Due to data loss from a drive failure, the **full production code and datasets are not available.**  
However, I’ve included **code snippets, architectural overviews, and visual references** to demonstrate the system’s structure, methodology, and technical depth.  
This repository serves as a **technical showcase** of my work and approach — not a functional release.

## 💡 Project Motivation

This project was a personal passion and professional growth challenge — developed **independently while taking advanced courses at MIT and Harvard** in machine learning, quantitative methods, and data systems engineering.

The goal was to design a **fully autonomous trading system** that could:
- Perform **real-time market data analysis** and signal generation  
- Manage **risk dynamically** based on customizable parameters  
- **Adapt** its algorithmic strategy based on performance and volatility  
- Execute trades through secure APIs with **failsafes** and **capital protection mechanisms**

## 🧩 System Architecture

The system was designed around **modularity**, **speed**, and **fault tolerance**.  
Here’s a high-level breakdown:

### 🔹 Core Components
- **Data Layer:** Historical and live data ingestion from Yahoo Finance, Alpaca, and Bloomberg APIs  
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering using Pandas & NumPy  
- **Modeling:**  
  - Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) for time series forecasting  
  - XGBoost and ensemble models for trend classification  
  - Neural networks (PyTorch, CUDA-accelerated) for deep pattern recognition  
- **Execution Engine:**  
  - Alpaca API for trade execution  
  - Multi-market trading capability (stocks, forex, crypto, futures)  
  - Rule-based and learned strategy selection  
- **Risk Management:**  
  - Configurable risk ratios  
  - Stop-loss, trailing stops, and volatility-based position sizing  
- **Prediction & Alerts:**  
  - Market open/close timers and alerts  
  - Predictive model for price movement likelihood (up/down)  
  - Historical pattern recognition for event-driven triggers

## 🔍 Why This Repository Exists

While the original project code is no longer fully intact, this repository stands as:
1. A **technical record** of my engineering and quantitative methods  
2. A **demonstration of capability** in designing, training, and deploying complex ML-driven trading systems  
3. A **foundation** for future redevelopment — potentially as an open-source quant framework or startup platform  

This project represents the culmination of **self-directed research**, **hands-on experimentation**, and **academic training** across data science, quantitative finance, and applied machine learning.

## 🧭 Vision & Next Steps

I plan to rebuild a next-generation version of this system from the ground up — leveraging:
- More advanced transformer architectures (possibly LLMs fine-tuned for market context)
- Real-time distributed computation  
- Adaptive learning pipelines that continuously refine trading behavior  
- Code efficency for faster computation time with less recourses
- 
If you’re a quant firm, startup, or research lab interested in **collaboration or evaluation**, feel free to reach out — I’m open to discussions, insights, and opportunities.
